# discovery.k8s.io @ v1beta1

## Resource discovery.k8s.io/EndpointSlice@v1beta1
* **Valid Scope(s)**: Unknown
### Properties
* **addressType**: string (Required): addressType specifies the type of address carried by this EndpointSlice. All addresses in this slice must be the same type. This field is immutable after creation. The following address types are currently supported: * IPv4: Represents an IPv4 Address. * IPv6: Represents an IPv6 Address. * FQDN: Represents a Fully Qualified Domain Name.
* **apiVersion**: 'discovery.k8s.io/v1beta1' (ReadOnly, DeployTimeConstant): APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
* **endpoints**: [IoK8SApiDiscoveryV1Beta1Endpoint](#iok8sapidiscoveryv1beta1endpoint)[] (Required): endpoints is a list of unique endpoints in this slice. Each slice may include a maximum of 1000 endpoints.
* **kind**: 'EndpointSlice' (ReadOnly, DeployTimeConstant): Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
* **metadata**: [IoK8SApimachineryPkgApisMetaV1ObjectMeta](#iok8sapimachinerypkgapismetav1objectmeta) (Required, Identifier): ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects users must create.
* **ports**: [IoK8SApiDiscoveryV1Beta1EndpointPort](#iok8sapidiscoveryv1beta1endpointport)[]: ports specifies the list of network ports exposed by each endpoint in this slice. Each port must have a unique name. When ports is empty, it indicates that there are no defined ports. When a port is defined with a nil port value, it indicates "all ports". Each slice may include a maximum of 100 ports.

## IoK8SApiCoreV1ObjectReference
### Properties
* **apiVersion**: string: API version of the referent.
* **fieldPath**: string: If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an object.
* **kind**: string: Kind of the referent. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
* **name**: string: Name of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names
* **namespace**: string: Namespace of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/
* **resourceVersion**: string: Specific resourceVersion to which this reference is made, if any. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency
* **uid**: string: UID of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#uids

## IoK8SApiDiscoveryV1Beta1Endpoint
### Properties
* **addresses**: string[] (Required): addresses of this endpoint. The contents of this field are interpreted according to the corresponding EndpointSlice addressType field. Consumers must handle different types of addresses in the context of their own capabilities. This must contain at least one address but no more than 100.
* **conditions**: [IoK8SApiDiscoveryV1Beta1EndpointConditions](#iok8sapidiscoveryv1beta1endpointconditions): EndpointConditions represents the current condition of an endpoint.
* **hostname**: string: hostname of this endpoint. This field may be used by consumers of endpoints to distinguish endpoints from each other (e.g. in DNS names). Multiple endpoints which use the same hostname should be considered fungible (e.g. multiple A values in DNS). Must pass DNS Label (RFC 1123) validation.
* **targetRef**: [IoK8SApiCoreV1ObjectReference](#iok8sapicorev1objectreference): ObjectReference contains enough information to let you inspect or modify the referred object.
* **topology**: [IoK8SApiDiscoveryV1Beta1EndpointTopology](#iok8sapidiscoveryv1beta1endpointtopology): topology contains arbitrary topology information associated with the endpoint. These key/value pairs must conform with the label format. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels Topology may include a maximum of 16 key/value pairs. This includes, but is not limited to the following well known keys: * kubernetes.io/hostname: the value indicates the hostname of the node
  where the endpoint is located. This should match the corresponding
  node label.
* topology.kubernetes.io/zone: the value indicates the zone where the
  endpoint is located. This should match the corresponding node label.
* topology.kubernetes.io/region: the value indicates the region where the
  endpoint is located. This should match the corresponding node label.

## IoK8SApiDiscoveryV1Beta1EndpointConditions
### Properties
* **ready**: bool: ready indicates that this endpoint is prepared to receive traffic, according to whatever system is managing the endpoint. A nil value indicates an unknown state. In most cases consumers should interpret this unknown state as ready.

## IoK8SApiDiscoveryV1Beta1EndpointPort
### Properties
* **appProtocol**: string: The application protocol for this port. This field follows standard Kubernetes label syntax. Un-prefixed names are reserved for IANA standard service names (as per RFC-6335 and http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names). Non-standard protocols should use prefixed names such as mycompany.com/my-custom-protocol.
* **name**: string: The name of this port. All ports in an EndpointSlice must have a unique name. If the EndpointSlice is dervied from a Kubernetes service, this corresponds to the Service.ports[].name. Name must either be an empty string or pass DNS_LABEL validation: * must be no more than 63 characters long. * must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or '-'. * must start and end with an alphanumeric character. Default is empty string.
* **port**: int: The port number of the endpoint. If this is not specified, ports are not restricted and must be interpreted in the context of the specific consumer.
* **protocol**: string: The IP protocol for this port. Must be UDP, TCP, or SCTP. Default is TCP.

## IoK8SApimachineryPkgApisMetaV1ManagedFieldsEntry
### Properties
* **apiVersion**: string: APIVersion defines the version of this resource that this field set applies to. The format is "group/version" just like the top-level APIVersion field. It is necessary to track the version of a field set because it cannot be automatically converted.
* **fieldsType**: string: FieldsType is the discriminator for the different fields format and version. There is currently only one possible value: "FieldsV1"
* **fieldsV1**: any: Any object
* **manager**: string: Manager is an identifier of the workflow managing these fields.
* **operation**: string: Operation is the type of operation which lead to this ManagedFieldsEntry being created. The only valid values for this field are 'Apply' and 'Update'.
* **time**: string: Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.

## IoK8SApimachineryPkgApisMetaV1ObjectMeta
### Properties
* **annotations**: [IoK8SApimachineryPkgApisMetaV1ObjectMetaAnnotations](#iok8sapimachinerypkgapismetav1objectmetaannotations): Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations
* **clusterName**: string: The name of the cluster which the object belongs to. This is used to distinguish resources with same name and namespace in different clusters. This field is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is going to ignore it if set in create or update request.
* **creationTimestamp**: string (ReadOnly): Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.
* **deletionGracePeriodSeconds**: int (ReadOnly): Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only.
* **deletionTimestamp**: string (ReadOnly): Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.
* **finalizers**: string[]: Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.
* **generation**: int (ReadOnly): A sequence number representing a specific generation of the desired state. Populated by the system. Read-only.
* **labels**: [IoK8SApimachineryPkgApisMetaV1ObjectMetaLabels](#iok8sapimachinerypkgapismetav1objectmetalabels): Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and services. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels
* **managedFields**: [IoK8SApimachineryPkgApisMetaV1ManagedFieldsEntry](#iok8sapimachinerypkgapismetav1managedfieldsentry)[] (ReadOnly): ManagedFields maps workflow-id and version to the set of fields that are managed by that workflow. This is mostly for internal housekeeping, and users typically shouldn't need to set or understand this field. A workflow can be the user's name, a controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like "ci-cd". The set of fields is always in the version that the workflow used when modifying the object.
* **name**: string (Required, DeployTimeConstant, Identifier): Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names
* **namespace**: string (DeployTimeConstant, Identifier): Namespace defines the space within which each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty.

Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces
* **ownerReferences**: [IoK8SApimachineryPkgApisMetaV1OwnerReference](#iok8sapimachinerypkgapismetav1ownerreference)[]: List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller.
* **resourceVersion**: string (ReadOnly): An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a resource or set of resources. Clients must treat these values as opaque and passed unmodified back to the server. They may only be valid for a particular resource or set of resources.

Populated by the system. Read-only. Value must be treated as opaque by clients and . More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency
* **selfLink**: string (ReadOnly): SelfLink is a URL representing this object. Populated by the system. Read-only.

DEPRECATED Kubernetes will stop propagating this field in 1.20 release and the field is planned to be removed in 1.21 release.
* **uid**: string (ReadOnly): UID is the unique in time and space value for this object. It is typically generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to change on PUT operations.

Populated by the system. Read-only. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids
