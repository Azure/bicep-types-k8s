## IoK8SApimachineryPkgApisMetaV1ManagedFieldsEntry
### Properties
* **apiVersion**: string: APIVersion defines the version of this resource that this field set applies to. The format is "group/version" just like the top-level APIVersion field. It is necessary to track the version of a field set because it cannot be automatically converted.
* **fieldsType**: string: FieldsType is the discriminator for the different fields format and version. There is currently only one possible value: "FieldsV1"
* **fieldsV1**: any: Any object
* **manager**: string: Manager is an identifier of the workflow managing these fields.
* **operation**: string: Operation is the type of operation which lead to this ManagedFieldsEntry being created. The only valid values for this field are 'Apply' and 'Update'.
* **subresource**: string: Subresource is the name of the subresource used to update that object, or empty string if the object was updated through the main resource. The value of this field is used to distinguish between managers, even if they share the same name. For example, a status update will be distinct from a regular update using the same manager name. Note that the APIVersion field is not related to the Subresource field and it always corresponds to the version of the main resource.
* **time**: string: Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.

## IoK8SApimachineryPkgApisMetaV1ObjectMeta
### Properties
* **annotations**: [IoK8SApimachineryPkgApisMetaV1ObjectMetaAnnotations](#iok8sapimachinerypkgapismetav1objectmetaannotations): Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations
* **creationTimestamp**: string (ReadOnly): Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.

* **deletionTimestamp**: string (ReadOnly): Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.
* **finalizers**: string[]: Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.
* **generation**: int (ReadOnly): A sequence number representing a specific generation of the desired state. Populated by the system. Read-only.
* **labels**: [IoK8SApimachineryPkgApisMetaV1ObjectMetaLabels](#iok8sapimachinerypkgapismetav1objectmetalabels): Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and services. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels
* **managedFields**: [IoK8SApimachineryPkgApisMetaV1ManagedFieldsEntry](#iok8sapimachinerypkgapismetav1managedfieldsentry)[] (ReadOnly): ManagedFields maps workflow-id and version to the set of fields that are managed by that workflow. This is mostly for internal housekeeping, and users typically shouldn't need to set or understand this field. A workflow can be the user's name, a controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like "ci-cd". The set of fields is always in the version that the workflow used when modifying the object.
* **name**: string (Required, DeployTimeConstant, Identifier): Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names#names
* **namespace**: string (DeployTimeConstant, Identifier): Namespace defines the space within which each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty.

Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces
* **ownerReferences**: [IoK8SApimachineryPkgApisMetaV1OwnerReference](#iok8sapimachinerypkgapismetav1ownerreference)[]: List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller.
* **resourceVersion**: string (ReadOnly): An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a resource or set of resources. Clients must treat these values as opaque and passed unmodified back to the server. They may only be valid for a particular resource or set of resources.

Populated by the system. Read-only. Value must be treated as opaque by clients and . More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency
* **selfLink**: string (ReadOnly): Deprecated: selfLink is a legacy read-only field that is no longer populated by the system.
* **uid**: string (ReadOnly): UID is the unique in time and space value for this object. It is typically generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to change on PUT operations.

Populated by the system. Read-only. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names#uids

## IoK8SApiNetworkingV1HttpIngressPath
### Properties
* **backend**: [IoK8SApiNetworkingV1IngressBackend](#iok8sapinetworkingv1ingressbackend) (Required): IngressBackend describes all endpoints for a given service and port.
* **path**: string: path is matched against the path of an incoming request. Currently it can contain characters disallowed from the conventional "path" part of a URL as defined by RFC 3986. Paths must begin with a '/' and must be present when using PathType with value "Exact" or "Prefix".
* **pathType**: string (Required): pathType determines the interpretation of the path matching. PathType can be one of the following values: * Exact: Matches the URL path exactly. * Prefix: Matches based on a URL path prefix split by '/'. Matching is
  done on a path element by element basis. A path element refers is the
  list of labels in the path split by the '/' separator. A request is a
  match for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the
  request path. Note that if the last element of the path is a substring
  of the last element in request path, it is not a match (e.g. /foo/bar
  matches /foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz).
* ImplementationSpecific: Interpretation of the Path matching is up to
  the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate PathType
  or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types.
Implementations are required to support all path types.

* **kind**: string (Required): kind is the type of resource being referenced.
* **name**: string (Required): name is the name of resource being referenced.
* **namespace**: string: namespace is the namespace of the resource being referenced. This field is required when scope is set to "Namespace" and must be unset when scope is set to "Cluster".
* **scope**: string: scope represents if this refers to a cluster or namespace scoped resource. This may be set to "Cluster" (default) or "Namespace".

## IoK8SApiNetworkingV1IngressClassSpec
### Properties
* **controller**: string: controller refers to the name of the controller that should handle this class. This allows for different "flavors" that are controlled by the same controller. For example, you may have different parameters for the same implementing controller. This should be specified as a domain-prefixed path no more than 250 characters in length, e.g. "acme.io/ingress-controller". This field is immutable.
* **parameters**: [IoK8SApiNetworkingV1IngressClassParametersReference](#iok8sapinetworkingv1ingressclassparametersreference): IngressClassParametersReference identifies an API object. This can be used to specify a cluster or namespace-scoped resource.

## IoK8SApiNetworkingV1IngressLoadBalancerIngress

* **protocol**: string (Required): protocol is the protocol of the ingress port. The supported values are: "TCP", "UDP", "SCTP"

## IoK8SApiNetworkingV1IngressRule
### Properties
* **host**: string: host is the fully qualified domain name of a network host, as defined by RFC 3986. Note the following deviations from the "host" part of the URI as defined in RFC 3986: 1. IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can only apply to
   the IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress.
2. The `:` delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed.
	  Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http and
	  :443 for https.
Both these may change in the future. Incoming requests are matched against the host before the IngressRuleValue. If the host is unspecified, the Ingress routes all traffic based on the specified IngressRuleValue.

host can be "precise" which is a domain name without the terminating dot of a network host (e.g. "foo.bar.com") or "wildcard", which is a domain name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. "*.foo.com"). The wildcard character '*' must appear by itself as the first DNS label and matches only a single label. You cannot have a wildcard label by itself (e.g. Host == "*"). Requests will be matched against the Host field in the following way: 1. If host is precise, the request matches this rule if the http host header is equal to Host. 2. If host is a wildcard, then the request matches this rule if the http host header is to equal to the suffix (removing the first label) of the wildcard rule.
* **http**: [IoK8SApiNetworkingV1HttpIngressRuleValue](#iok8sapinetworkingv1httpingressrulevalue): HTTPIngressRuleValue is a list of http selectors pointing to backends. In the example: http://<host>/<path>?<searchpart> -> backend where where parts of the url correspond to RFC 3986, this resource will be used to match against everything after the last '/' and before the first '?' or '#'.

## IoK8SApiNetworkingV1IngressServiceBackend
### Properties
* **name**: string (Required): name is the referenced service. The service must exist in the same namespace as the Ingress object.
* **port**: [IoK8SApiNetworkingV1ServiceBackendPort](#iok8sapinetworkingv1servicebackendport): ServiceBackendPort is the service port being referenced.

## IoK8SApiNetworkingV1IngressSpec
### Properties
* **defaultBackend**: [IoK8SApiNetworkingV1IngressBackend](#iok8sapinetworkingv1ingressbackend): IngressBackend describes all endpoints for a given service and port.
* **ingressClassName**: string: ingressClassName is the name of an IngressClass cluster resource. Ingress controller implementations use this field to know whether they should be serving this Ingress resource, by a transitive connection (controller -> IngressClass -> Ingress resource). Although the `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation (simple constant name) was never formally defined, it was widely supported by Ingress controllers to create a direct binding between Ingress controller and Ingress resources. Newly created Ingress resources should prefer using the field. However, even though the annotation is officially deprecated, for backwards compatibility reasons, ingress controllers should still honor that annotation if present.
* **rules**: [IoK8SApiNetworkingV1IngressRule](#iok8sapinetworkingv1ingressrule)[]: rules is a list of host rules used to configure the Ingress. If unspecified, or no rule matches, all traffic is sent to the default backend.
* **tls**: [IoK8SApiNetworkingV1IngressTLS](#iok8sapinetworkingv1ingresstls)[]: tls represents the TLS configuration. Currently the Ingress only supports a single TLS port, 443. If multiple members of this list specify different hosts, they will be multiplexed on the same port according to the hostname specified through the SNI TLS extension, if the ingress controller fulfilling the ingress supports SNI.

## IoK8SApiNetworkingV1IngressStatus
### Properties
* **loadBalancer**: [IoK8SApiNetworkingV1IngressLoadBalancerStatus](#iok8sapinetworkingv1ingressloadbalancerstatus): IngressLoadBalancerStatus represents the status of a load-balancer.

## IoK8SApiNetworkingV1IngressTLS
### Properties
* **hosts**: string[]: hosts is a list of hosts included in the TLS certificate. The values in this list must match the name/s used in the tlsSecret. Defaults to the wildcard host setting for the loadbalancer controller fulfilling this Ingress, if left unspecified.
* **secretName**: string: secretName is the name of the secret used to terminate TLS traffic on port 443. Field is left optional to allow TLS routing based on SNI hostname alone. If the SNI host in a listener conflicts with the "Host" header field used by an IngressRule, the SNI host is used for termination and value of the "Host" header is used for routing.

## IoK8SApiNetworkingV1IPAddressSpec
### Properties
* **parentRef**: [IoK8SApiNetworkingV1ParentReference](#iok8sapinetworkingv1parentreference) (Required): ParentReference describes a reference to a parent object.

## IoK8SApiNetworkingV1NetworkPolicyPeer
### Properties
* **ipBlock**: [IoK8SApiNetworkingV1IPBlock](#iok8sapinetworkingv1ipblock): IPBlock describes a particular CIDR (Ex. "192.168.1.0/24","2001:db8::/64") that is allowed to the pods matched by a NetworkPolicySpec's podSelector. The except entry describes CIDRs that should not be included within this rule.
* **namespaceSelector**: [IoK8SApimachineryPkgApisMetaV1LabelSelector](#iok8sapimachinerypkgapismetav1labelselector): A label selector is a label query over a set of resources. The result of matchLabels and matchExpressions are ANDed. An empty label selector matches all objects. A null label selector matches no objects.
* **podSelector**: [IoK8SApimachineryPkgApisMetaV1LabelSelector](#iok8sapimachinerypkgapismetav1labelselector): A label selector is a label query over a set of resources. The result of matchLabels and matchExpressions are ANDed. An empty label selector matches all objects. A null label selector matches no objects.

## IoK8SApiNetworkingV1NetworkPolicyPort
### Properties
* **endPort**: int: endPort indicates that the range of ports from port to endPort if set, inclusive, should be allowed by the policy. This field cannot be defined if the port field is not defined or if the port field is defined as a named (string) port. The endPort must be equal or greater than port.
* **port**: string: IntOrString is a type that can hold an int32 or a string.  When used in JSON or YAML marshalling and unmarshalling, it produces or consumes the inner type.  This allows you to have, for example, a JSON field that can accept a name or number.
* **protocol**: string: protocol represents the protocol (TCP, UDP, or SCTP) which traffic must match. If not specified, this field defaults to TCP.

## IoK8SApiNetworkingV1NetworkPolicySpec
### Properties
* **egress**: [IoK8SApiNetworkingV1NetworkPolicyEgressRule](#iok8sapinetworkingv1networkpolicyegressrule)[]: egress is a list of egress rules to be applied to the selected pods. Outgoing traffic is allowed if there are no NetworkPolicies selecting the pod (and cluster policy otherwise allows the traffic), OR if the traffic matches at least one egress rule across all of the NetworkPolicy objects whose podSelector matches the pod. If this field is empty then this NetworkPolicy limits all outgoing traffic (and serves solely to ensure that the pods it selects are isolated by default). This field is beta-level in 1.8
* **ingress**: [IoK8SApiNetworkingV1NetworkPolicyIngressRule](#iok8sapinetworkingv1networkpolicyingressrule)[]: ingress is a list of ingress rules to be applied to the selected pods. Traffic is allowed to a pod if there are no NetworkPolicies selecting the pod (and cluster policy otherwise allows the traffic), OR if the traffic source is the pod's local node, OR if the traffic matches at least one ingress rule across all of the NetworkPolicy objects whose podSelector matches the pod. If this field is empty then this NetworkPolicy does not allow any traffic (and serves solely to ensure that the pods it selects are isolated by default)
* **podSelector**: [IoK8SApimachineryPkgApisMetaV1LabelSelector](#iok8sapimachinerypkgapismetav1labelselector) (Required): A label selector is a label query over a set of resources. The result of matchLabels and matchExpressions are ANDed. An empty label selector matches all objects. A null label selector matches no objects.
* **policyTypes**: string[]: policyTypes is a list of rule types that the NetworkPolicy relates to. Valid options are ["Ingress"], ["Egress"], or ["Ingress", "Egress"]. If this field is not specified, it will default based on the existence of ingress or egress rules; policies that contain an egress section are assumed to affect egress, and all policies (whether or not they contain an ingress section) are assumed to affect ingress. If you want to write an egress-only policy, you must explicitly specify policyTypes [ "Egress" ]. Likewise, if you want to write a policy that specifies that no egress is allowed, you must specify a policyTypes value that include "Egress" (since such a policy would not include an egress section and would otherwise default to just [ "Ingress" ]). This field is beta-level in 1.8

## IoK8SApiNetworkingV1ParentReference
### Properties
* **group**: string: Group is the group of the object being referenced.
* **name**: string (Required): Name is the name of the object being referenced.
* **namespace**: string: Namespace is the namespace of the object being referenced.
* **resource**: string (Required): Resource is the resource of the object being referenced.

## IoK8SApiNetworkingV1ServiceBackendPort
### Properties
* **name**: string: name is the name of the port on the Service. This is a mutually exclusive setting with "Number".
* **number**: int: number is the numerical port number (e.g. 80) on the Service. This is a mutually exclusive setting with "Name".

## IoK8SApiNetworkingV1ServiceCidrSpec
### Properties
* **cidrs**: string[]: CIDRs defines the IP blocks in CIDR notation (e.g. "192.168.0.0/24" or "2001:db8::/64") from which to assign service cluster IPs. Max of two CIDRs is allowed, one of each IP family. This field is immutable.

## IoK8SApiNetworkingV1ServiceCidrStatus
### Properties
* **conditions**: [IoK8SApimachineryPkgApisMetaV1Condition](#iok8sapimachinerypkgapismetav1condition)[]: conditions holds an array of metav1.Condition that describe the state of the ServiceCIDR. Current service state
