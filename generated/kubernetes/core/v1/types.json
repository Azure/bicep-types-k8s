Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.\n\nWhen a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.\n\nBefore serializing, Quantity will be put in \"canonical form\". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:\n\n- No precision is lost - No fractional digits will be emitted - The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.\n\nThe sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.\n\nExamples:\n\n- 1.5 will be serialized as \"1500m\" - 1.5Gi will be serialized as \"1536Mi\"\n\nNote that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.\n\nNon-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)\n\nThis format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation."},"resource":{"Type":4,"Flags":1,"Description":"Required: resource to select"}}}},{"2":{"Name":"IoK8SApiCoreV1SecretKeySelector","Properties":{"key":{"Type":4,"Flags":1,"Description":"The key of the secret to select from.

As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains, scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.

When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.\n\nFor example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/2: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  | The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so \"global minimum\" is treated as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones, it will violate MaxSkew.\n\nThis is a beta field and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default)."},"nodeAffinityPolicy":{"Type":4,"Flags":0,"Description":"NodeAffinityPolicy indicates how we will treat Pod's nodeAffinity/nodeSelector when calculating pod topology spread skew.

Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.\n\nWhen a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.\n\nBefore serializing, Quantity will be put in \"canonical form\". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:\n\n- No precision is lost - No fractional digits will be emitted - The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.\n\nThe sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.\n\nExamples:\n\n- 1.5 will be serialized as \"1500m\" - 1.5Gi will be serialized as \"1536Mi\"\n\nNote that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.\n\nNon-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)\n\nThis format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation."}}}},{"2":{"Name":"IoK8SApiCoreV1EphemeralVolumeSource","Properties":{"volumeClaimTemplate":{"Type":195,"Flags":0,"Description":"PersistentVolumeClaimTemplate is used to produce PersistentVolumeClaim objects as part of an EphemeralVolumeSource."}}}},{"2":{"Name":"IoK8SApiCoreV1PersistentVolumeClaimTemplate","Properties":{"metadata":{"Type":196,"Flags":0,"Description":"ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects users must create."},"spec":{"Type":61,"Flags":1,"Description":"PersistentVolumeClaimSpec describes the common attributes of storage devices and allows a Source for provider-specific attributes"}}}},{"2":{"Name":"IoK8SApimachineryPkgApisMetaV1ObjectMeta","Properties":{"annotations":{"Type":197,"Flags":0,"Description":"Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata.
